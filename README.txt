Grace Keane
A Multithreaded Language Detector Project 2019/2020

Starting program
--------------------------
When the program is run the user is shown the purpose of the program e.g. Text Language Detector. My program is fully titled and
structured so that the user knows exactly what do while using the my program. This will reduce confusion. 
e.g Generating a new thread..., Loading..., Starting thread..., In Parse Method, Next Language, Building subject database...
please wait.

Next the user is prompted with a menu to enter their name and surname. After this is done the program creates a greeting
message using the name given e.g. "Welcome to the program Grace Keane".

Then the user is presented with the option to use the small text file (wili-2018-Small-11750-Edited.txt) or the large file
(wili-2018-Large-117500-Edited.txt). He/she is prompted to enter 1 or 2. If the user enters a number that is not 
specified the program then quits and an error message is shown e.g Invalid input. Please try again.

when the user specifies the file they want to use, the program then parses each word into k-mers of size 5. 
After this is done the full language line is shown with the correct name of the language.
